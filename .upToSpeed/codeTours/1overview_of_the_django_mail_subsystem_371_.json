An e-mail backend is a method of sending e-mail messages. Options include printing the e-mail to the command line or a file, doing nothing, as well as sending it for real using SMTP. These are provided by the various subclasses of `BaseEmailBackend` in the `backends` folder. The chief method of an e-mail backend implementation is `send_messages`. By default, each invocation of `send_messages` will open a separate network connection (for network-based backends); however, through the `open` and `close` methods, code using e-mail backends may batch many groups of messages across the same connection.","title":"","id":"4312"},{"type":"highlight","description":"An e-mail message consists of standard e-mail headers (`from`, `to`, `CC`, `BCC`, `subject`, etc), body, and attachments.
